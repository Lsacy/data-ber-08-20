## Project Description
I build a strong random password generator. Because I was interested in how something like that might work.

## Rules
User has to choose a digit between 8-16. A randomly generated password with letters (lower and upper case) and a few special charaters are added.

## Workflow
1. defining of lists with all the possible charaters which can be used for the final password.
2. user input with exception handling. User is required to enter a digit between 8 and 16.
3. generation of the password with the length of user requested input.
